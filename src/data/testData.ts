This shift offers significant advantages such as greater flexibility for employees, reduced commute times, and access to a wider global talent pool for employers. However, it also presents challenges like potential feelings of isolation among staff, difficulties in maintaining company culture, and the need for robust digital security measures. Companies are now tasked with developing new strategies to maximize the benefits of remote work while effectively mitigating its drawbacks.`;

export const listeningScript = `Hi Mark, have you had a chance to look at the quarterly sales report yet?

Hi Anna, yes, I went through it this morning. The figures are generally positive, especially in the Asian market. However, I'm a bit concerned about the dip in sales last month in Europe.

I saw that too. I think it might be related to the delayed marketing campaign. Let's schedule a brief meeting with the European team to discuss it. How about tomorrow at 10 am?

That works for me. I'll send out the calendar invites. Should we ask them to prepare some initial thoughts on the decline?

That's a good idea. Let's ask them to bring any data they have on customer feedback from that period as well.`;
